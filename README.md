# Playground for dynamics on the Muller-Brown potential.

### Chain-of-state methods for finding MEPs
Some Jupyter notebooks related to the String Method:
- ./examples/0ksm_muller
> 0ksm_muller/stringm_muller.ipynb: String Method on a Muller potential surface, without using Numpy;
- ./examples/voro_fe
> voro_fe/hwfe_voro_sm.ipynb: Used to post-processes the Voronoi (hard wall) collision matrix from CHARMM string method simulations, which gives MFEP profiles;
> voro_fe/voro0.dat: Data file (of the Voronoi HW simulation ALA dipeptide dihedral rotation) used as an example in hwfe_voro_sm.ipynb.
